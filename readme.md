#presentation on SOLID principles

Presentation for my BeCode class. 

It's a meta presentation: the presentation itself is written in code that implements the topic of the presentation.
index.php is the presentation, the versions of Slide.php serve as examples to the SOLID principles.
Version 0 implements OOP, Version 1 implements S, version 2 implements O, version 3 implements L, version 4 implements I.
I and D need some extra explanation besides the code because this project is too small to properly show their use.

The presentation is based on https://blog.bitsrc.io/solid-principles-every-developer-should-know-b3bfa96bb688
